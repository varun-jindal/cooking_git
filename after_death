Now we will add another_file2 and add some text,
->stage it, call it 1
->add some more stage again call it 2
->and then unstage, it should return to end stage of 1 after commiting

--> What might have happened to another_file1??

It was created
git rm doesn't work if not tracking the file
staged another_file

Did i commit and then rm OR
i rm and commited

i think i removed and when i actually tracked it again, then it accepted my change, had i not tracked it commit would have restored it

Lets try last experiment first with another_reborn
