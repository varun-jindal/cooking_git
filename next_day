Experimenting with checkout
Need to find way to switch between commits easily instead of through hash
Also branches have names, so checkout becomes easier
Checkout goes to state when commit with input hash was made, ie if i now make a branch and do some stuff and checkout <some hash> it should go back in time,
But this behaviour is then different for branches, it just switches in that case
also what if i add something while i am checking out some earlier commit?

Really scary, commiting in past instance without making branch can cause potential loss of files
I recovered because in past log i had hash of other commits
--> As it was recovered it means that the files do exist!!
----> So i need to find way to recover in case i didn't had previous hashes

Also "git branch <branch-name> <hash of branch>" makes branch at the point where file is created

|-|----|-|----|-|
     --|-| <-- here is our file

Also git checkout takes you to most recent version of the branch
