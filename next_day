Experimenting with checkout
Need to find way to switch between commits easily instead of through hash
Also branches have names, so checkout becomes easier
Checkout goes to state when commit with input hash was made, ie if i now make a branch and do some stuff and checkout <some hash> it should go back in time,
But this behaviour is then different for branches, it just switches in that case
also what if i add something while i am checking out some earlier commit?
